	<h1>Net Neutrality Opposition</h1>
	<p>There are many organizations currently in opposition to net neutrality. ISPs such as Comcast are prominent among them, as they don't want to lose out on the money of the people they will charge for tiered services. Some key net neutrality opponents are Comcast, IBM, Intel, Cisco, AT&T, and a group called Hands off the Internet.</p>
